# 52projects

One project every week in 2017 to learn about new stuff

### Background

The new year typically brings with it reflection on the past and a renewed sense of goals in which to complete. I am getting too comfortable in my skill set and I think I need a bit of challenge. Inspired by a [presentation](https://speakerdeck.com/jeffersonlam/reflections-from-52-weeks-52-projects) by Jefferson Lam and [52 technologies](https://github.com/shekhargulati/52-technologies-in-2016), I've decided to do a project every week in 2017 to learn about new stuff. It could be frameworks, programming languages, development tools, making use of APIs, or other things. Or, it could be things that I have done in the past that I would like to revisit, for example, C programming in 2017.

A project will be in a separate GitHub repository and the list is kept below.

Wish me luck, hopefully I do not stop in the middle of the year ;)
